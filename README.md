**OMNITRIX** shows one of the best combinations of different penetration testing tools whose different methodologies and techniques are used by ethical hackers, penetration testers or pen-testers and security researchers also. As per minor project, this project contains 5 different types of penetration testing tools which is developed, designed and created by **[RAJNISH KUMAR](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajnish-kumar-eh/)** with the help of **[PYTHON](https://www.python.org/)** programming language and **[SHELL/BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** scripting.

A penetration test or pen test is a simulated cyber-attack which is done by penetration testers or pen testers against any computer system, network system, and web applications to check the security weaknesses and find out the exploitable vulnerabilities to protect the systems. There are different types of pen-testing such as network services testing, web application testing, mobile application testing, wireless testing, social engineering and physical attempts. A penetration tester uses different types of techniques, methodologies and tools which helps them to identify the attack vectors or the exploitable vulnerabilities and loop holes in network.

## PROPOSED SYSTEM & ITS ADVANTAGES
The project **OMNITRIX** is a combination of 5 different types of tools which is made with the intention to use the tool for pen-testing. Penetration testers do the system and network pen-testing to prevent out the malicious activities by finding the attack vectors and weaknesses before the attacker attack and that will result as bad cyber-attack which results of the data loss for the system or organization.

The process of penetration testing simulates the cyber security kill chain. Pen-testers begin the whole process in 5 different stages which are:
1. Reconnaissance or Foot Printing.
2. Scanning.
3. Gaining Access.
4. Maintaining Access.
5. Clearing or Covering Tracks.

Now, this tool will contain different types of executive python files to run the whole tool smoothly. There will be different types of network scanners, port scanners, vulnerability scanners and also more different types of pen-testing tools.

**Note: This tool is only made for Debian Based Linux Operating System such as Kali Linux Operating system and Parrot Security Operating System which are Debian Based Linux OS.**

## ADVANTAGES OF USING TOOL OMNITRIX
- **OMNITRIX** having some different scanning tools like vulnerability scanner, port scanners and service scanners.
- Pen-testers can use this tool to do deep penetration testing in a simple and organized way on any of the network or a particular system.
- Any beginner in the field of ethical hacking & cyber security can use this tool simply. Even a person having a good networking knowledge or network engineers can use this tool to pen-test their own system or home networks.
